### Whats is hell LNK ? 

<p>An LNK file is a Windows Shortcut that serves as a pointer to open a file, folder, or application. LNK files are based on the Shell Link binary file format, which holds information used to access another data object. </p>

### How to Add Formats ?

<p>To add new formats to lnk builder, you must first create a logo (ico format only) for the application, then you will need to define the file name with the desired format extension, for example, I want to add the zip format, file name was "zip.ico" and put the file in "icon" folder</p>
